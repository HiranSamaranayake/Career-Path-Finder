                                Liverpool John Moores University’s BA (Hons) Interior Design degree programme at SLIIT School of Architecture provides students to work on authentic architectural projects with input from practicing architects and interior design specialists in a dynamic studio environment with industry-standard technical facilities. This program emphasizes creative inspiration and philosophical interpretation of broader issues, resulting in complex design projects.

                                the interior design modules are formulated to help students to develop the sensitivity as a designer to respond to creative adaptation, repurposing, remodeling, restyling, and refitting of new and existing buildings and spaces when designing and to instill the skills required to use of a range of communication mediums to convey design ideas including drawings, models, and graphics. Subject knowledge is primarily gained through studio environments that are seamlessly briefed by lectures, tutorials, and workshops.
